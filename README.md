# creaderDAOtest

This is the Creader.io Project repository.

The aim of this project is to create a blockchain-driven platform for authors to break free from the traditional publishing industry and to create a new way of publishing and reading books.
We also want to create a new way of reading books, where the reader can interact with the author and other readers. Furthermore, the reader can also earn some incentives for engagement.

Copyright is a big issue in the publishing industry. We want to create a new way of copyrighting books. With the help of NFT, we hope to help authors prove that they are the original author of the book easier.


## Structure

The project is divided into 2 parts:

- The smart contract **copyright-protection-contract**
- The frontend **copyright-protection-frontend**
